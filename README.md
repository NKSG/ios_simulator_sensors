ios_simulator_sensors
=====================

A basic solution to allow the inclusion of sensors into the iOS 6 simulator. The way in which iOS deals with sensors has changed since iOS 5 and the old solution (https://github.com/HBehrens/accelerometer-simulator) will soon no longer work. I have updated this to work on the new iOS simulator and it includes all the sensors. (Accelerometer, Gyro, Magnetometer)
